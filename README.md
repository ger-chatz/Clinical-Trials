#  Clinical Trials Survival Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project explores survival data from clinical trials using established statistical methodologies. The goal is to model survival times and assess which clinical variables influence patient outcomes, applying both non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches.

>  This analysis was conducted as part of the MSc in Applied Statistics at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

## Questions Covered
1. 2×2 Crossover Trial (Carryover & Period Effect, Equivalence Test)
2. Meta-analysis on Vascular Event Trials (Fixed Effect, OR Estimation, Publication Bias)
3. Depression Trial Over Time (GLMM, Time-Treatment-Diagnosis Interaction)
4. Randomization for 3 Treatment Arms (Block Randomization in R)
5. Sample Size Calculations (Continuous and Binary Outcomes)
6. Hypothesis Testing with Logistic Regression
7. Survival Analysis using Cox Proportional Hazards Model
8. Poisson Regression for Count Data
9. Multi-arm Trial Power Analysis

##  Tools & Technologies
- **R** for statistical modeling
- `survival`, `survminer` for survival analysis
- `ggplot2` for data visualization
- `dplyr`, `tidyverse` for data wrangling

##  Methodology
- **Kaplan-Meier Estimation**: Non-parametric survival function estimation by treatment groups
- **Log-Rank Test**: Comparing survival distributions
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: Estimating covariate effects on survival
- **Diagnostics**: Schoenfeld residuals & proportional hazards assumption checking
