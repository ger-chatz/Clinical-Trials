#  Clinical Trials Survival Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project explores survival data from clinical trials using established statistical methodologies. The goal is to model survival times and assess which clinical variables influence patient outcomes, applying both non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches.

>  This analysis was conducted as part of the MSc in Applied Statistics at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

##  Tools & Technologies
- **R** for statistical modeling
- `survival`, `survminer` for survival analysis
- `ggplot2` for data visualization
- `dplyr`, `tidyverse` for data wrangling

##  Methodology
- **Kaplan-Meier Estimation**: Non-parametric survival function estimation by treatment groups
- **Log-Rank Test**: Comparing survival distributions
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Model**: Estimating covariate effects on survival
- **Diagnostics**: Schoenfeld residuals & proportional hazards assumption checking

##  Project Files
- `clinical trials.pdf` – Complete report including methodology, code output, and results

##  Key Insights
- Several clinical variables showed significant impact on patient survival
- Visualizations and model diagnostics validated the assumptions of the Cox model
- Recommended strategies for interpretation and further clinical studies
